# EH Archive

EH Archive is the replacement for the legacy scripts in `old/`. It separates
collection, download, validation, preparation, upload and cleanup into
recoverable services driven by PostgreSQL state.

## Quick start

1. Create a Python 3.11+ environment (this repository uses Conda environment `eh`: `conda create -n eh python=3.11`) and install `pip install -e ".[dev]"`; qBittorrent support is part of the base installation.
2. Create the ignored `config/` directory and copy `app.toml`, `supervisor.toml`, `crawl.toml` and `secrets.toml` from the tracked `config.sample/` directory. To use video-archive special processing, also copy `config.sample/special/video_archive.toml` to `config/special/video_archive.toml`. Fill in PostgreSQL, service, crawl, storage, ffmpeg and the special work root; video downloads reuse the APP qBittorrent and local torrent roots. The entire runtime `config/` directory is local-only and ignored by Git.
3. Run `eharchive db upgrade` (or `python -m eh_archive.cli db upgrade`).
4. Start `eharchive-web` and `eharchive-supervisor` as separate processes.

The complete Chinese setup and operations guide is [docs/usage.zh-CN.md](docs/usage.zh-CN.md).

The Supervisor runs periodic collection and bounded on-demand
screen/download/validation/upload/cleanup workers. After each upload worker finishes its batch, it requests one global
LANraragi thumbnail regeneration pass.

The Web “特殊处理” area provides persistent, user-driven one-shot workflows.
It only writes workflow/job requests to PostgreSQL; Supervisor starts the
allowlisted worker processes. The first module combines a manually selected
image torrent and video torrent, converts MP4 files to animated WebP, and
returns one validated ZIP to the ordinary `downloaded -> validate` pipeline.

The `scripts/` directory contains one-time MySQL migration and reconciliation
tools. Runtime code never imports those scripts.
